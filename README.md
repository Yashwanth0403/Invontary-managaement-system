Inventory Management System

This project is a simple Inventory Management System that performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It allows users to manage a list of products by adding new items, viewing the available products, updating existing product details, and deleting products from the inventory. The system is developed using Python and stores product information using basic file handling or a lightweight database like SQLite, depending on your setup. The application is easy to run and use, making it suitable for beginners who are learning how CRUD operations work in a real-world project. To run the project, simply clone the repository, open your terminal or command prompt, and execute the main.py file using Python. The interface is text-based and provides a simple menu for navigating different options. This project is a good starting point for anyone looking to understand how data is managed in small applications.
